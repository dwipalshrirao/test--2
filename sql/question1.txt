output for given query
"""
SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races)
"""

is 

-------------------
id | name |
..............
1 | John Doe
...............
5 | Lisa Romero
------------------

explanation:-
above query loads all "winner_id" from "races" table and check if "id" from "runners" table exist in 
"winner_id" columns of "races" table and return rows from "runners" table.

As I menetioned, above query loads all "winner_id" from "races" table every row "runners" table
which can be problem if "races" table has large number of rows.


alternative query:

SELECT r.*
FROM runners r
LEFT JOIN races ra ON r.id = ra.winner_id
WHERE ra.winner_id IS NULL;
