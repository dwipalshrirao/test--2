Date which follows given Distributions does not have a log-normal distribution or a Gaussian distribution 

1] Uniform Distribution
2] Exponential Distribution
3] Binomial Distribution
4] Poisson Distribution

example:- 
we know that a fair die has sides 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and Each side is equal probality i.e. 1/6.
if it is thown large number of times then  Each number from 1 to 6 will occur with approximately equal frequency. 
it will not create a bell-shaped histogram but it will follow Uniform distribution.
