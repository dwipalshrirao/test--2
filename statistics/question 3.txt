The five-number summary is a descriptive statistics technique used to summarize the distribution of a data. 
It consists of five key values that provides information about the range, central tendency, and variability of the data.
These five numbers are:

1] Minimum - The smallest value in the data.
2] First Quartile (Q1): The value below which 25% of the data fall. It is also known as the First quartile.
3] Median (Q2): The middle value of the data when it is ordered from smallest to largest. 
                It represents the 50th percentile of the data and divides the data into two equal halves.

4] Third Quartile (Q3): The value below which 75% of the data fall. It is also known as the upper quartile.
5] Maximum: The largest value in the data.

expample: -
data = [2,1,6,  5, 15, 7, 9, 12,  18, 19, 27]

sort the list  in ascending order 
data.sort()
data =  [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 27]


Find the minimum and maximum for your data set. Now that your numbers are in order, this should be easy to spot.
 the minimum (the smallest number) is 1 and 
 the maximum (the largest number) is 27.

Find the median:
     The median is the middle number. 

Find First Quartile (Q1) and Third Quartile (Q3):
    let's separate data for Q1 and Q3
    (1, 2, 5, 6, 7), 9, (12, 15, 18, 19, 27)
    ---------------     --------------------
      first half           second half

if we calculate median of 1st half then we get Q1 = 5
and same in 2nd half then we get Q3 = 18
